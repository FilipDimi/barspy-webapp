A restaurant owner reached out to me and asked me if I can build a webapp where he can keep track of the bar inventory.

Barspy is a simple webapp where the manager can keep track of the bar's inventory, and every night he gets an email
of what was used that day & which products are low on stock.

Barspy is built with Django, PostgreSQL & Bootstrap and it's hosted on heroku.
